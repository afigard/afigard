I'm a freelance full-stack developer.

I specialize in building fast, scalable web apps with React, Next.js, and GraphQL.

I've worked with large companies like Thales and Bouygues Telecom, delivering production-ready tools in collaborative teams.

Currently preparing to work remotely and open to global clients.
